Welcome to the **Motivational Quote Sender** project! Elevate your Mondays with a burst of positivity through randomly generated motivational quotes delivered straight to your inbox. Let's embark on a journey of inspiration together.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- **Python 3**
- **Active Gmail account**

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/motivational-quote-sender.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project:**

    ```bash
    cd motivational-quote-sender
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Open the `motivational_quote_sender.py` file and personalize the following variables:

```python
my_email = "your@gmail.com"
password = "your_password"
receiver = "recipient@example.com"
day_to_send = 0  # Set to your preferred day (0 = Monday)
```

## Running the Script

Execute the script with:

```bash
python motivational_quote_sender.py
```

The script checks if today aligns with the specified day to deliver a motivational quote. If affirmative, a randomly selected quote from `quotes.txt` will be sent to the provided email address.

## Customization

Make this experience uniquely yours by modifying quotes in `quotes.txt` or experimenting with different email formats. Add more functionality to cater to your preferences and share the positivity.
